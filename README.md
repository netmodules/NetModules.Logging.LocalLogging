# NetModules.Logging.LocalLogging

**NetModules.Logging.LocalLogging** is a [NetModules](https://github.com/netmodules/NetModules) module that handles the built in [LoggingEvent](https://github.com/netmodules/NetModules/blob/main/NetModules/Events/LoggingEvent.cs) and outputs to Console 8f available, as well as logging to local files.

Every loaded module in a loaded ModuleHost can raise a `LoggingEvent` either mannually by instantiating and sending it to Host.Handle, or by using to `this.Log` wrapper method. A module doesn't need to worry about how logging is handled unless it's a logging module!

## NetModules.Logging.LocalLogging.Events

The **NetModules.Logging.LocalLogging** module handles and exposes its own events for interacting with the local log files, these events can be referenced and raised by other modules to read log data.

### These events are as follows:

- **LastLine**: Returns the last `LoggingEvent` record in the event otput.
- **ReadLogFile**: Returns n lines from the local log file in the event output.
- **SearchLogFile**: Returns n lines from the local log file that match a query in the event output.
- **SetLoggingLevel**: Allows you to dynamically override the logging level that is written to local files. This may be useful if you need to read a level urgently.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To use **NetModules.Logging.LocalLogging**, add the library to a project where you instantiate a [ModuleHost](https://github.com/netmodules/NetModules/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-and-loading-a-module-host) via NuGet Package Manager:
```bash
Install-Package NetModules.Logging.LocalLogging
```
Logging will be automatically enabled when you load the module into your ModuleHost. 


To use events from **NetModules.Logging.LocalLogging.Events**, add the events library to a module project via NuGet Package Manager:
```bash
Install-Package NetModules.Logging.LocalLogging.Events
```
You can then instantiate an event and raise it to ModuleHost via your module's `this.Host.Handle` method for a handling module to process.
